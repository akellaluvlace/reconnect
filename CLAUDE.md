# Rec+onnect MVP — Command Center

AI-powered Strategic Recruitment Operations Platform. Irish market, 8-week build, multi-tenant SaaS.
Stack: Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase (RLS) + Claude AI (Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.5) + Whisper + Resend

---

## Current State

**Step:** 5 — Web App Shell + Core UI (COMPLETE, reviewed + all 25 issues fixed)
**Status:** Steps 1-3 + 5 complete. Next: Step 4 (Landing Page) or Step 6 (AI Platform) or Step 7 (Playbook Creation)
**Next task:** Client to set up external services (see EXTERNAL_SETUP.md), then continue build
**Blockers:** None

> Update this section at end of every session.

## Session Protocol

1. This file is auto-loaded. Read it first.
2. Read `.claude/SWARM_STATUS.md` for detailed progress and blocker list.
3. Read `steps/step-{NN}-*.md` for whichever step you're working on.
4. Read `.claude/agents/{role}.md` only if acting as a specific agent.
5. Start work. Do NOT read other docs unless the File Map below says to.

## Hard Constraints

These are non-negotiable client decisions. Do not ask about them — they're settled.

- **Desktop-only** — no mobile responsive, min 1024px
- **Ratings 1-4** — NOT 1-5
- **NO AI hire/no-hire recommendation** — highlights only, human decides
- **Email-only notifications** — no in-app, use Resend
- **Auth:** Email+password + Google OAuth + Microsoft OAuth — NO LinkedIn
- **No PDF/CSV export** — everything stays in system, Google Drive export only
- **1-year data retention** then auto reachout to candidate to opt in/out
- **JSONB feedback:** `ratings` (array of {category, score 1-4}), `pros`/`cons` (JSONB arrays), `focus_areas_confirmed` (boolean, required)
- **AI constraints:** 2-3 focus areas per stage, 3-5 questions per focus area
- **EU AI Act:** Text-only analysis, no emotion/voice/biometric inference, human review disclaimers mandatory
- **1 admin per org**, user belongs to ONE org only
- **CMS admin controls:** Skills, industries, levels, stage templates, question bank, JD templates, email templates

## File Map

Read files ONLY when the situation matches:

| File | When to Read |
|------|-------------|
| `.claude/SWARM_STATUS.md` | Every session start (progress + blockers) |
| `steps/step-{NN}-*.md` | When working on that step |
| `.claude/agents/{role}.md` | When acting as a specific agent |
| `docs/CLAUDE_SWARM.md` | If unsure about swarm rules or agent roles |
| `docs/PLAN.md` | If reviewing step order or macro plan |
| `docs/issuesFound.md` | When hitting a blocker or starting Step 3 (RLS decisions) |
| `docs/questionsAnswered.md` | When unsure about a client decision not listed above |
| `docs/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | For schemas, API contracts, deep technical reference |
| `docs/Reconnect_Technical_Specification_v3.md` | For original spec details |
| `docs/Reconnect_Setup_Guide.md` | During Step 1 service account setup |
| `docs/Reconnect_Project_Context.md` | For commercial terms or timeline context |

**Never read** unless debugging a past decision: `docs/DOCUMENT_REVIEW_LOG.md`, `docs/SESSION_LOG_2026-02-03.md`

## Work Protocol

1. Branch: `step{NN}-{micro}-{slug}` (e.g., `step03-2-rls-policies`)
2. Stay within allowed paths for your micro step
3. Implement minimal diff — don't over-engineer
4. Verify: run DoD commands from the step file (lint, typecheck, tests)
5. Report: state what was done, what passed, any blockers
6. If blocked: document exact error + what you tried + options
7. **NEVER sign commits** with `Co-Authored-By` or any attribution line. Plain commit messages only.

Full rules: `docs/CLAUDE_SWARM.md` (8 agents, merge gates, compliance gates)

---

## Session End Protocol

Before ending a session, ALWAYS do these:

1. **Update `.claude/SWARM_STATUS.md`** — mark completed micro steps, update Current Work table, add blockers if any
2. **Update this file's "Current State" section** — set correct step, status, next task, blockers
3. **Add 1-line entry to Recent Sessions below** — keep only last 5 entries
4. Do NOT create separate session log files
