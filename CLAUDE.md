## Current State

**Step:** 10.3 IN PROGRESS. Code pushed to master. Production LIVE.
**Status:** Steps 1-9 complete + hardened. 10.1 DONE. 10.2 tested + hardened. 10.2b DONE. Recall.ai integration BUILT + HARDENED + VERIFIED E2E (2026-03-25). 10.3 partial: production build verified, console.log cleanup, dead code removal, S3 URL fix, cron fallback for Recall polling. 10.4 security audit done (2026-03-20). 32 migrations ALL DEPLOYED. 753 tests green. Typecheck clean.
**Next task:** Finish 10.3 (bundle analysis, code splitting, cross-browser). Then 10.5-10.8.
**Blockers:** OpenAI credits (asked Robert 2026-03-24, no reply). Blocks Whisper manual upload path only.
**Cleared blockers:** All Vercel env vars fixed (2026-03-25). All 3 migrations deployed (2026-03-25). Recall.ai recording verified E2E (2026-03-25). Google Meet Access Type → Open (2026-03-25). All 7 Robert feedback items DONE (2026-03-24).
**Implemented (2026-03-25):** Vercel env var fixes (trailing newlines on CRON_SECRET + GOOGLE_RECORDING_*). S3 URL domain check fix in fetchTranscript. Cron Phase 1b: Recall.ai bot polling fallback. getBot returns status_changes.
**Implemented (2026-03-24):** Rename "Playbook" → "Hiring Plan" (30+ strings, 18 files). Coverage reframed (no percentage, advice-based). Bulk invite dialog (paste emails, parallel sends, dedup). Dead code cleanup (feedback-loader, rating-helpers, stripAIMetadata).
**Deployments:** axil.ie (landing) LIVE + SSL. app.axil.ie (web app) LIVE + SSL. All OAuth redirect URIs verified. Vercel linked. All env vars verified.

**Safe point:** `fa78660` (2026-03-26) — full E2E pipeline verified. Revert here if beta prep breaks anything.

**Build order:** ~~10.1~~ → ~~all hardening~~ → ~~Option A~~ → ~~prefetch fix~~ → ~~production audit~~ → ~~Alignment chapter~~ → ~~Alignment enhancements~~ → ~~Debrief chapter (D2-D4)~~ → ~~CMS Admin Controls~~ → ~~Platform Superadmin~~ → ~~Org approval~~ → ~~Collaborator prep page~~ → ~~CMS email integration~~ → ~~10.2 (recording + feedback + consent)~~ → ~~10.2b (notifications)~~ → ~~Recall.ai integration~~ → ~~Robert's feedback items~~ → **Beta prep (in progress)**: Sentry, audit logging, bundle analysis, cross-browser

**Manual testing results (2026-03-17):**
- Interview scheduling via UI → Google Calendar + Meet link: WORKING
- Reschedule/cancel/no-consent: WORKING
- Cron pipeline detect + transition (scheduled→pending): WORKING
- Conference record detection via Meet API: WORKING
- Transcript retrieval (Google Docs export 2630 chars + Meet API 11 entries): WORKING (with axil.ie user in call)
- Transcript NOT generated without Workspace user in call: CONFIRMED LIMITATION
- Add Candidate UI+API: BUILT + WORKING
- Admin feedback form in Debrief Feedback tab: BUILT + WORKING
- AI Synthesis with transcript: WORKING (Claude correctly analyzed transcript + feedback, flagged issues, generated discussion points)
- AI Synthesis persistence + reload from DB: FIXED (was broken — wrong column name `created_at` → `generated_at`)
- AI Synthesis now includes transcript: FIXED (was only checking `recording_status === "completed"`, now also checks `"transcribed"`)
- Debrief tab enabled with sequential chapter gating: WORKING
- Competitor listings 70% relevance cutoff: DONE
- Discovery section confirm buttons + "Continue to Process" banner: DONE
- Platform admin "Back to Dashboard" link: DONE
- Hydration fix (date formatting en-IE): DONE
- Google OAuth scopes updated: calendar (full), drive.readonly (broader). Re-authorized.
- Drive search fallback for transcript docs: BUILT + WORKING

**All tested flows (2026-03-17):**
- Google Meet auto-transcription (rcoffey in call): 2630 chars, Google Docs + Meet API entries WORKING
- Manual upload + Whisper: 14220 chars from 16-min MP3, 47s transcription WORKING
- Collaborator feedback (token-based, incognito): correct focus areas, 1-4 ratings, submit + duplicate block WORKING
- Admin feedback form in Debrief: WORKING
- AI Synthesis with transcript (both paths): WORKING — correctly flags issues, cross-references ratings vs transcript
- Interview scheduling → Calendar + Meet link: WORKING
- Cron pipeline (detect → pending → transcript retrieval): WORKING
- Add Candidate: WORKING
- Sequential chapter gating (UI + server-side): WORKING

**Bugs fixed during testing:**
- `ai_synthesis.created_at` → `generated_at` (column name mismatch)
- Synthesis not including transcript (wrong recording_status check)
- Synthesis not loading from DB on page mount (no GET endpoint + no useEffect)
- Google OAuth scope too narrow (`calendar.events` → `calendar`, `drive.meet.readonly` → `drive.readonly`)
- Hydration mismatch on date formatting (toLocaleString → toLocaleString("en-IE"))
- Debrief tab was hardcoded disabled
- No Add Candidate UI (empty Debrief page with no way forward)
- No admin feedback form (only collaborator token flow existed)
- Role mismatch `hiring_manager` → `manager`
- OpenAI project key out of credits — needs top-up before deploy

**Client feedback (2026-03-17):** Competitor listings 70% cutoff DONE. Section confirm buttons DONE. Edit requirements: Option C DONE (review step), Option B declined for now. Recording: Robert aware of costs, needs to figure out pricing for Axil. Awaiting decisions: "Playbook" rename, coverage analysis removal, share link merge, bulk invite.

## Session Protocol

1. This file is auto-loaded. Read it first.
2. Read `.claude/SWARM_STATUS.md` for detailed progress and blocker list.
3. Read `steps/step-{NN}-*.md` for whichever step you're working on.
4. Read `.claude/agents/{role}.md` only if acting as a specific agent.
5. Start work. Do NOT read other docs unless the File Map below says to.

---

## Hard Constraints

These are non-negotiable client decisions. Do not ask about them — they're settled.

- **NO git commands without explicit user approval** — never commit, push, branch, checkout, stash, reset, or any other git operation unless the user explicitly asks for it. This includes creating commits after completing work. Always wait for the user to say "commit", "push", etc.

- **Desktop-only** — no mobile responsive, min 1024px
- **Ratings 1-4** — NOT 1-5
- **NO AI hire/no-hire recommendation** — highlights only, human decides
- **Email-only notifications** — no in-app, use Resend
- **Auth:** Email+password + Google OAuth + Microsoft OAuth — NO LinkedIn
- **No PDF/CSV export** — everything stays in system
- **Google Drive + Meet = core recording infrastructure** — **shared Rec+onnect Google Workspace account** (platform-level, NOT per-org). App creates Meet events with interviewer as co-host → auto-record on join → recording saved to Rec+onnect's Drive → Meet API retrieves exact file ID → Whisper transcribes → Claude synthesizes. Per-org folder isolation in shared Drive. See `docs/INTERVIEW_RECORDING_FLOW.md`.
- **Share links: token-only URL** — no password protection, secure random token + rate limiting
- **Share link data scope: minimal** — collaborator sees: candidate first name + role, their stage, focus areas + questions, their feedback form. NO access to other feedback, salary, CV, AI synthesis, scores, or full playbook
- **Magic link auth: Supabase Auth OTP** — clicking magic link creates temporary Supabase auth session. Existing RLS policies work unchanged via `auth.uid()`.
- **AI synthesis: transcript + feedback** — Claude analyzes BOTH the full interview transcript AND structured feedback forms. Token counting required (150K soft limit). Transcript stays server-side only.
- **1-year data retention** then auto reachout to candidate to opt in/out
- **JSONB feedback:** `ratings` (array of {category, score 1-4}), `pros`/`cons` (JSONB arrays), `focus_areas_confirmed` (boolean, required)
- **AI constraints:** 2-3 focus areas per stage, 3-5 questions per focus area
- **EU AI Act:** Text-only analysis, no emotion/voice/biometric inference, human review disclaimers mandatory
- **1 admin per org**, user belongs to ONE org only
- **CMS admin controls:** Skills, industries, levels, stage templates, question bank, JD templates, email templates

## Work Protocol

1. Branch: `step{NN}-{micro}-{slug}` (e.g., `step03-2-rls-policies`)
2. Stay within allowed paths for your micro step
3. Implement minimal diff — don't over-engineer
4. Verify: run Definition of Done commands from the step file (lint, typecheck, tests)
5. Report: state what was done, what passed, any blockers
6. If blocked: document exact error + what you tried + options
7. **NEVER sign commits** with `Co-Authored-By` or any attribution line. Plain commit messages only.

Full rules: `docs/CLAUDE_SWARM.md` (8 agents, merge gates, compliance gates)

---

## Review Protocol

Rules for running automated code review agents. Learned from Step 6 QA (7 agents, 90+ findings, 33% signal-to-noise ratio).

### Agent Selection

Use **3 focused agents max**, not 7 overlapping ones:

| Agent | Use For | Strength |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter` | After any step completion | Best signal-to-noise — finds real silent failures |
| `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer` | After schema/type changes | Catches drift between layers (Zod vs domain vs DB) |
| `coderabbit:code-reviewer` | General coverage | Good breadth, moderate noise |

Skip multiple `superpowers:code-reviewer` instances on the same code — they duplicate each other.

### Triage Before Fixing

**Never bulk-fix all findings.** Follow this flow:

1. **Collect** — run agents, let them all finish
2. **Deduplicate** — merge identical findings across agents (expect 40-60% overlap)
3. **Present** — show the user a deduplicated list with severities
4. **Get approval** — user picks which findings to fix
5. **Fix in batches** — group by category (errors, types, validation, etc.)
6. **Test after each batch** — typecheck + test after each category, not just at the end

### False Positive Rules

- **Never trust severity labels** — automated "CRITICAL" may be wrong. Cross-reference before acting.
- **Verify existence claims** — if a tool says "version X doesn't exist" or "function Y is unused," verify with `npm view`, `grep`, etc. before changing anything.
- **Conflicting advice** — when two agents recommend different fixes for the same issue, pick the simpler one or ask the user. Don't implement both.
- **"Should add" suggestions** — agents love suggesting additions (rate limiting, concurrency limits, timeouts). These are backlog items, not blockers. Note them but don't implement unless explicitly requested.

### Blast Radius Awareness

Before implementing a review fix, check:

- **Does this type/interface have consumers?** Changing `FocusArea.area` → `FocusArea.name` is safe before Step 7 (no UI consumers), dangerous after.
- **Does this change cascade?** Tightening `code: string` → `code: AIErrorCode` requires updating every test that constructs that type.
- **Is the fix in the right layer?** Input validation (`.max()`) belongs in API routes, not in the AI package schemas.

### What NOT to Fix From Reviews

- Performance suggestions (concurrency limits, caching strategies) — backlog, not blocking
- "Add tests for X" — valid but not a fix, schedule separately
- Style preferences (import ordering, naming conventions) — ignore unless project-wide
- Architecture critiques ("should use dependency injection") — ignore for MVP

---

## Recall.ai Operations

**Delete test recordings** (to clean up before client sees them):
```bash
# POST (not DELETE) to /delete_media/ for each bot ID
curl -s -X POST "https://eu-central-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/{BOT_ID}/delete_media/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token $RECALL_API_KEY"
```
Media is permanently removed. Bot metadata (meeting URL, status) stays 14 days then auto-clears.

**List all bots:** `GET https://eu-central-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/?limit=50`

---

## Pipeline Tracer Protocol

Two instrumentation layers trace every AI pipeline call. **Check these logs FIRST when debugging flow issues — before reading source code.**

### Where: `apps/web/.next/dev/logs/next-development.log`

### PipelineTrace (`[TRACE:pipeline:step]`) — data flow
Every pipeline has `PipelineTrace` wired in (`packages/ai/src/tracer.ts`). Shows what params went in, what came out, what was missing.

**Reading the chain — look for these in sequence:**
1. `[TRACE:quickInsights]` → wizard generates quick market data
2. `[TRACE:deepInsights]` + `[TRACE:deepResearch]` → background deep research (60-80s)
3. `[TRACE:generateHiringStrategy]` → should show `salary_range`, `required_skills_count > 0`
4. `[TRACE:generateJobDescription]` → should show `has_market_context=true, has_strategy_context=true`
5. `[TRACE:generateStages]` → should show `has_jd_context=true, has_strategy_context=true`
6. `[TRACE:analyzeCoverage]` → should show `stages_count > 0, required_requirements > 0`
7. `[TRACE:generateCandidateProfile]` → should show `has_market_skills=true` (after fix)

**Red flags:** `has_*_context=false`, `*_count=0`, `FAIL`, `warnings_count > 0`, `"No context data provided"`

### PipelineLogger (`[AI:endpoint]`) — API calls
Every Anthropic API call logged (`packages/ai/src/logger.ts`). Format: `[AI:endpoint] model=X tokens=IN+OUT latency=Xms stop=X`

**Red flags:** `latency > 60000ms`, `COERCED`, `ERROR=`, `stop=max_tokens`

### DO NOT check Playwright logs (`.playwright-mcp/`) — those are E2E test console captures, not pipeline traces.

---

## Pre-Beta Checklist (Gate Before 10.6)

Everything below MUST pass before any beta tester gets access. Not optional.

### Infrastructure
- [x] All migrations deployed to production (32 total, all deployed 2026-03-25)
- [x] Env vars set in Vercel (Supabase, Anthropic, Tavily, OpenAI, Resend, Google, Recall.ai, CRON_SECRET — all verified 2026-03-25)
- [x] Rate limiting on AI endpoints — in-memory per-user throttle (10 req/min) on all 10 AI routes
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry or equivalent) configured

### Data Integrity
- [ ] RLS verified against real DB: admin sees all, manager sees org, interviewer sees assigned
- [ ] Blind feedback verified: interviewer cannot see others' feedback via API or UI
- [ ] Share link data scope verified: no salary, CV, AI synthesis, or full playbook data leaks
- [ ] Transcript privacy verified: no API route returns raw transcript to client
- [ ] FK cascades work: deleting a stage doesn't crash interviews or candidates

### UI/UX
- [ ] Every page click-tested: Landing → Login → Register → Playbooks list → Wizard → Discovery → Process → Alignment → Debrief
- [ ] Empty states: new org (no playbooks), empty playbook (no stages), empty stage (no interviews)
- [ ] Error states: network failure during AI generation, invalid form submission, expired session
- [ ] Cross-browser: Chrome + Firefox + Edge (desktop, 1024px min)
- [ ] AI disclaimer visible on every AI-generated output

### Compliance
- [ ] EU AI Act: text-only analysis, no emotion/voice inference, human review disclaimer
- [ ] Recording consent flow: candidate can decline, interview proceeds without recording
- [ ] No hire/no-hire recommendation anywhere in UI or AI output
- [ ] Data retention plan communicated to client (1-year auto-reachout is spec'd but not built — confirm deferral)

### Known Gaps (Accept or Fix Before Beta)
- **~~Anthropic API credits exhausted~~** Topped up 2026-03-01. AI generation working. ~$0.80/playbook (with 2 improvement loops).
- **Data retention cron:** Not implemented. Needs client decision: build now or defer.
- **Audit logging:** No admin action logging. Low risk for beta, needed for production.
- **~~Rate limiting~~:** DONE (2026-03-07). In-memory per-user throttle, 10 req/min, all AI routes.
- **~~Lint errors~~:** DONE (2026-03-07). 0 errors (was 25). Fixed `no-explicit-any`, unescaped entities, react-hooks issues.

### Pipeline Flow Issues (updated 2026-03-03)
- **~~Deep research fire-and-forget — no recovery.~~** ALREADY FIXED: 8-minute polling timeout → amber retry banner → `handleRetryDeepResearch()` re-triggers with same cache_key. Implemented in `market-intelligence-panel.tsx`.
- **~~Vercel function timeout on deep research.~~** FIXED (2026-03-03): `maxDuration=300` on ALL AI route handlers (11 routes). Vercel Pro supports up to 300s. Strategy route was timing out at 120s — bumped in resilience round.
- **~~Candidate profile — no gating on Alignment page.~~** FIXED (2026-03-05): Profile prompt now enriched with emerging_premium skills, stage_types_summary, coverage_gaps. Stale detection warns when strategy updated. Inline editing + AI refine per-section.
- **Stage generation latency: 81-90s consistently.** Confirmed across 2 runs (81s and 90s). Near timeout boundary. **Fix:** Monitor in production, consider splitting into smaller calls if timeouts occur.
- **`parseJsonb` transient failure on page load.** Quick-phase market data can fail validation when Discovery page loads during deep research. Causes brief `null` marketInsights state. Self-resolves when polling updates. **Fix (low priority):** Use a looser schema for quick-phase data, or handle null gracefully in tab gating (already does — tabs stay locked).
- **Stage question count under target.** AI consistently generates 4-5 questions when prompt asks for 6+. Confirmed across 8 stages in 2 runs. Not random — AI self-limits. **Fix (low priority):** Strengthen prompt constraints or add retry on under-count.
- **AI score optimism bias: +6.5 points average.** Across 6 measurements, AI overestimates coverage by 5-14 points. One anomaly of -12. Programmatic score override is essential and working. No action needed — just awareness.
- **~~Competitor listings cache write error.~~** FIXED (2026-03-02): Migration adds `'listings'` to cache phase CHECK constraint.
- **~~Triple refinement generation on same input.~~** FIXED (2026-03-02): Input hash guard skips identical regeneration. Regenerate button disabled during generation.
- **~~Merge `replaces` miss.~~** FIXED (2026-03-02): Better warning message includes existing FA names. Merge warnings surfaced to user via toast.
- **~~Anchored coverage fallback to full re-eval + score regression.~~** FIXED (2026-03-03): When most FAs change, anchoring provides 0 benefit (all entries re-eval). AI was also reclassifying gap severity non-deterministically (minor→critical), causing 81%→78% regression. Fixed with: (1) gap severity floor — existing gaps can only decrease in severity, never increase, (2) monotonic score clamp — `Math.max(rawScore, previousScore)`. Trace now logs `raw_score`, `previous_score`, `clamped`.
- **~~P0 — Coverage score STUCK at 81-82%.~~** FIXED (2026-03-02): Gap-targeted re-evaluation + deterministic fallback. Prompt now tells AI which FA was SPECIFICALLY ADDED for which gap. If AI still misses, fallback forces gap to covered(weak). Guarantees monotonic score improvement. Prompt version bumped to 2.0.0. 5 new tests.
- **~~AI refinement cap: 2 iterations max.~~** REMOVED (2026-03-04): Recommendations panel deleted (Option A). Coverage improvements now done via direct stage editing + re-analysis. No cap needed.

## Session End Protocol

Before ending a session, ALWAYS do these:

1. **Update `.claude/SWARM_STATUS.md`** — mark completed micro steps, update Current Work table, add blockers if any
2. **Update this file's "Current State" section** — set correct step, status, next task, blockers
3. **Add 1-line entry to Recent Sessions below** — keep only last 5 entries
4. Do NOT create separate session log files
